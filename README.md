These are files from my Intro to Python Class, taken Spring 2024 from CWI.

The numbered files are etc homework assignments.

The four files at the bottom  with simple names are full projects from the class, these are what I am proud of.

There is a Tic-Tac-Toe Game, a Choose Your Own Adventure Game, a Contact Book, and a Number Guessing Game.
